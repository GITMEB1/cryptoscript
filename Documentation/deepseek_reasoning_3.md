Okay, I need to figure out how to help the user safely update their Python code on a remote server, specifically modifying the normalize_decimal function and imports. Theyâ€™ve had issues with regex replacements causing syntax errors, so I should avoid that. Let me recall their previous attempts and what went wrong.

First, the main problem is replacing the existing function with the new one without breaking the code. Regex can be tricky because it might match parts of the code inside strings or comments. AST-based parsing could be more reliable since it understands the code structure. But the user mentioned that AST is complex to implement. Maybe I can find a middle ground, using the AST to identify the exact location of the function and then perform replacements based on that.

Also, deployment scripts sometimes fail midway, so the solution needs good error handling and rollback. The user is using SSH/SCP from Windows to a Linux server, so the script should be compatible with that environment. Maybe using Python with paramiko for SSH operations would be better than raw PowerShell scripts for more control.

Let me start by considering how to safely modify the code. The AST approach can parse the code, find the function definition, check if it's the right one, and then replace it. That way, even if there are similar strings or function names, it won't accidentally replace the wrong part.

Next, the import line needs to be updated to include ROUND_HALF_UP. Again, checking the existing imports using AST or precise regex might work. For example, looking for 'from decimal import ...' and adding ROUND_HALF_UP if it's missing.

Deployment steps should include:

Backup the original file.
Modify the code (using AST for precise changes).
Validate the modified code syntax.
Deploy the modified file to the server.
Run tests remotely to confirm.
Rollback if any step fails.
For the code modification script in Python, using the ast module to parse and locate the function. Then, generate the new code with the replacement function. Also, check the imports. Maybe using the redbaron library could help with more straightforward code manipulation, but since it's a third-party library, it might need to be installed. Alternatively, stick with standard libraries.

Handling remote execution: Using paramiko to connect via SSH, transfer the modified file, and run commands. Need to handle exceptions, such as connection errors or syntax errors after modification. Also, maintaining backups on the server so that if the new code fails validation, it can roll back to the previous version.

Validation steps after deployment should include running the tests that were failing due to decimal precision. Maybe execute pytest remotely and check the output.

Putting it all together, the process would be:

Locally prepare the modified code with AST-based replacement.
Validate the code's syntax.
Backup the remote file via SCP.
Transfer the modified file.
Run remote validation (like compiling the code or running a syntax check).
If validation passes, restart the bot; else, revert using the backup.
Sample code could be a Python script that uses AST to modify the code, then uses paramiko for deployment. Error handling at each step, with logging and rollback mechanisms.

Testing the approach locally first before deploying to the server would be essential. Also, ensuring that the server has all necessary dependencies, like the paramiko library if used, or relying on standard modules.

Potential edge cases include the function being split across multiple lines, comments inside the function, or existing code that has similar patterns. The AST approach should naturally handle these since it parses the actual structure.

Finally, providing clear logging and status updates at each step so the user knows what's happening, and if a rollback occurs, they are informed. Including pre- and post-deployment checks to ensure system stability.
