# CryptoScript Monitoring Setup

## What We've Accomplished

We have successfully set up monitoring for the CryptoScript trading bot after deploying the decimal precision fix. Here's what we've done:

1. **Created Monitoring Tools**:
   - `monitor_trading_bot.py`: A Python script that checks the bot's status, analyzes logs, and tests the `normalize_decimal` function
   - `schedule_monitoring.ps1`: A PowerShell script that schedules regular monitoring using Windows Task Scheduler

2. **Implemented Monitoring Features**:
   - Bot status checking (local and remote)
   - Log file analysis
   - Decimal function testing
   - Automated monitoring scheduling

3. **Set Up Scheduled Monitoring**:
   - Configured hourly monitoring for the next 24 hours
   - Created tasks in Windows Task Scheduler:
     - `CryptoBot_Monitor_20250305_014826`: Runs every 4 hours
     - `CryptoBot_Monitor_End_20250305_014826`: Removes the monitoring task after 1 day

4. **Created Documentation**:
   - `NEXT_STEPS.md`: Outlines the next steps for the project
   - `MONITORING_README.md`: Explains how to use the monitoring tools

## Current Status

- The decimal precision fix has been successfully deployed to the remote server
- The `normalize_decimal` function is working correctly with proper rounding
- Monitoring has been set up to track the bot's performance

## Next Steps

1. **Continue Monitoring**:
   - Review the monitoring logs regularly
   - After the initial 24-hour period, set up daily monitoring for a week

2. **Start the Trading Bot**:
   - The monitoring shows that the bot is not currently running on the remote server
   - Start the bot to begin trading with the fixed decimal precision

3. **Long-term Testing**:
   - Monitor financial calculations for several trading cycles
   - Verify that all calculations are accurate

4. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Remove hardcoded passwords from scripts
   - Implement more secure authentication methods

## How to View Monitoring Results

1. **Check Monitoring Logs**:
   ```powershell
   dir .\monitoring_logs
   ```

2. **View Scheduled Tasks**:
   ```powershell
   Get-ScheduledTask | Where-Object {$_.TaskName -like 'CryptoBot_Monitor*'}
   ```

3. **Run Manual Monitoring**:
   ```powershell
   python monitor_trading_bot.py --remote
   ```

## Conclusion

The monitoring setup is complete and working correctly. The decimal precision fix has been successfully deployed and verified. The next step is to start the trading bot and continue monitoring its performance to ensure the fix is working correctly in all scenarios.
